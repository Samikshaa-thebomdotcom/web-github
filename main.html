                        You spot the grayish-bluish fin. You hear the echolocation being made. You see their beautiful jumps that can go as high as a basketball hoop.

                            Dolphins have a very different way of living life.
                            They are very social with others and swim in groups together which are known as <i> Pods</i> 
                            The social life of a bottlenose dolphin is an active one with different pods merging and intermingling and individuals often moving happily about among several social groups.

                                            <li> Dolphins have large brains with two hemispheres that are able to sleep at different times. Studies using the electroencephalogram (EEG) have shown that large, slow brain waves of sleep may appear on one brain hemisphere, while low-level, fast activity characteristic of waking may appear on the other brain hemisphere.
                                                In other words, the 2 different hemispheres of the brain take rotation. Since dolphins have to come up out of the water for air and need to be alert for predators,
                                               one side of the brain sleeps and rest while the other side stays awake.</li>

                                        Dolphins live in the world’s seas and oceans and in some rivers too. Some dolphin species prefer to live in coastal areas, others like shallow water but prefer to live away from the coast close to patches of shallower water which are located further out to sea.

                                        Orcas are the only dolphins which live in the Arctic and Antarctic. Their large size means that they have more protection against the harsh cold of the freezing seas. Most dolphins prefer tropical and temperate waters as they are warm-blooded mammals and so it is easier for them to regulate their body temperature in these environments.
                                        Bottlenose dolphins are found in temperate and tropical waters around the world. They inhabit a wide variety of habitats, including harbors, bays, gulfs, and estuaries, as well as nearshore coastal waters, deeper waters over the continental shelf, and even far offshore in the open ocean.
